# Socle docker Wordpress

Inspired by and based on (understand : copied/pasted from) Wodby images and WordPress stack.

Fine tuned to match my needs. Basically :

- Added a phpmyadmin image
- removed a whole lot of images that were not of use for me

Most of the credit goes to the [wodby crew](https://wodby.com/), who does an amazing job with those fantastic docker images. Give them some love, they deserve it

This is pretty much WIP : this is a pet-project of mine to better understand and work with docker and devOps methodology. So, I plan on adding a **_Makefile_** to kickstart wordpress projects, and do the same for Drupal 8 project (and pretty much any framework that I will fancy at a given time).
